# Network Data Analysis and KPI Dashboard

This project simulates and analyzes network traffic data to uncover performance trends.

## 🔍 Objective

To analyze KPIs like:
- 📈 Average Latency over time
- 🛠️ Network status (Active, Inactive, Error)
- 📊 Node-wise response times

## 📁 Files

- `network_analysis.ipynb`: Full Colab notebook with cleaning, SQL setup, and visualizations.
- `simulated_network_data.csv`: The dataset used (simulated).
- `README.md`: Project summary and structure.

## 📊 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQLite (in Colab)
- Google Colab

## 📌 Key Insights

- Identified latency trends over time
- Visualized network health using status codes
- Compared performance across network nodes
